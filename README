NAME
       mkpatch - incremental patch creator.

SYNOPSIS
       mkpatch  [PATCHES_DIR]  [UNPATCHED_PATH] [FULLY_PATCHED_PATH] [PATCH_NAME]
       [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       mkpatch is an incremental patch creator that  allows  you  to  create  and
       maintain  patches  between local directories or branches. It’s power comes
       from it’s incremental patch list, which it can  append  to  by  generating
       further  incremental patches, simply edit a single local patched directory
       and generate incremental patches against  an  unpatched  local  directory,
       without  needing to manage multiple patched directories, all while keeping
       an incremental patch list.

PATCH_DIR
       The PATCH_DIR acts as your incremental patchlist, and  can  be  either  an
       empty  directory,  or  a directory containing *.diff and/or *.patch files.
       These files must start with a number indicating patch order.

UNPATCHED_PATH
       The UNPATCHED_PATH is a directory containing code with no changes.

FULLY_PATCHED_PATH
       The FULLY_PATCHED_PATH is a directory containing all changes made  locally
       to the code.

EXAMPLES
       Example incrementally patching dwm and creating a new patch

       mkpatch ./patches ˜/.config/dwm/unpatched/6.4 ˜/.config/dwm/patched/6.4

OPTIONS

       --keep-temp, keep the temporary folder (good for debugging)
